*Objective
Learn how to use the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for solving classification problems.

*Tools Used
Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn

*Dataset
Iris Dataset (available in Scikit-learn)
Contains 150 samples of iris flowers with 4 features and 3 classes.

*Steps Performed
Load Data
Used the Iris dataset from Scikit-learn.
Preprocess Data
Normalized features using StandardScaler.
Split data into training and testing sets.

*Train Model
Used KNeighborsClassifier with k=3.
Trained the model on the training data.
Evaluate Model
Predicted values on the test set.
Checked accuracy and plotted the confusion matrix.
Visualize Decision Boundary
Used only the first two features.
Plotted decision boundaries to show class separation.

*Output
Accuracy score of the model
Confusion matrix plot
Decision boundary plot (2D)

*What i have Learned
How KNN works
Why normalization is important
How to choose the value of K
How to evaluate model performance
How to visualize classification results
